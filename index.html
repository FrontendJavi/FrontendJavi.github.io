    <p>I'm a apps development student from Madrid, Spain. My dreamn is to become a great frontend developer. I love HTML, CSS, WordPress, Dreamweaver and JavaScript. I consider myself as a very creative person, who's very retailer and always wants to learn new things. My favourite hobby is to travel. I have visited many European countries like Austria, Finland, Ireland or Portugal, and Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Norway are on the list :). And outside Europe I'd love to travel to Japan, it's the trip of my dreams. Also I'd like to go to South Korea, Canada, the USA and Australia.</p>
    <h1>My works. You'll enjoy them :)</h1>
